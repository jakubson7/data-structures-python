# Implementation of basic Data Structures in Python

And my silly attempts to reinvent the wheel because why not and they say it can be a learning experience or something.
Also, welcome to my **wonderland** of terribly written code.

# Todo

- [x] Write a README.md
- [ ] Write unit tests for dynamic array
- [ ] Write unit tests for singly linked list
- [ ] I don't know how, just make the code better.
